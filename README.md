This is my custom template for rapidly prototyping VR scenes. In edit mode you can move the avatar with the WASD keys to build your scene. When you want to check the scene in VR simply toggle the VR state to true in the useState hook. I recommend keeping the scenes in the scene folder and importing them into both the edit scene and the VR scene.
